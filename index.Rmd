I am a PhD student in Tatjana Scheffler's lab for [Digitale Forensische Linguistik](https://staff.germanistik.rub.de/digitale-forensische-linguistik/) at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum. My position is part of the [Sonderforschungsbereich Limits of Variability in Language.](https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/) at the Universität Potsdam. Our project studies how to transform texts across media. We are interested in how discourse phenomena such as discourse structure and particle use differ between texts in the spoken and written domain. We have created [PARADISE](https://osf.io/59acq/), a corpus of thematically parallel segments of podcasts and blog posts, annotated for various discourse phenomena. 


In my dissertation project, I study how German modal particles interact with discourse structure -- with more info to follow soon!
